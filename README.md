&nbsp;

Having 5 years of experience in Android Application development using Kotlin and Core Java. 

I am passionate about Mobile Applications & I enjoy learning new things.

These are some public repositories that are like learning projects & demonstrations of the skills that I have and some useful techniques & solutions that anyone can use for their work.

Apart from the official work I am currently working to bring some more interesting Android projects.
